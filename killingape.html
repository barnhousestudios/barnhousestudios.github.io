	<p class="text" style="font-size:150%;text-align:justify;padding-left:25%;">After detectives Mack and Rocky are fired, they set out to solve a murder case in an attempt to get their jobs back. What they don’t know is that the victim is part of a much bigger puzzle. Apes from outer space have invaded Earth and are killing and kidnapping humans for unknown reasons. The Killing Ape follows the stories of detectives Mack and Rocky, Colonel Apey McPoopypants, pipe-boy, and more characters during the invasion, in this action-packed absurdist comedy.<br /></p>
	<h3 class ="text" style="font-size:180%;padding-left:25%;text-align:center;">History & Potential</h3>
	<p class="text" style="font-size:150%;text-align:justify;padding-left:25%;">Made in the Summer of 2017, The Killing Ape is what Barnhouse Studios considers its first feature film. It's a 38-minute, live-action ,"horror" comedy. Obviously the setup of the movie is similar to that of The Planet of the Apes, and in some ways The Killing Ape is a parody of the series. However, it is most definitely different and unique enough to be considered its own independent movie. We see the potential for The Killing Ape to become a big franchise. That would mean sequels, possibly a prequil, and maybe even a TV series. There really is no limit to the amount of original, hilarious stories that could branch from the original movie.</p>
